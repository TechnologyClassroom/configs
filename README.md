This repo contains config files that I use.  This directory does not have the mass appeal of other directories.

awesome/rc.lua contains my awesome configuration that I use at work.

awesome/rc.lua.bak contains my awesome configuration that I use during presentations.

.bashrc contains suggestions for a .bashrc file.

.poca/poca.xml contains my podcatcher config.

jokes.txt is for .bashrc automatation.  As jokes are often heard and not sourced, I do not know where they came from.  I am sorry.
